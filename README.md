# reproducibility
understanding how much difference is seen between replicates in amphiphile preparations

Summary of data sets:

one composition.xlsx every well has the same mixture of seven amphiphiles in water. Rows 1-3 used ethanol to prepare the lipids, Rows 4-6 used 50:50 ethanol/water, Rows 7-9 used isopropanol, Rows 10-12 used 50:50 isopropanol water 

one compostion robot.csv same as one composition, but made with the robot

IPA Plate 1 + 2, and 50% ethanol plate 1+2 amphiphiles were disolved in stated solvent (IPA or 50% Ethanol/50% water) and made in the composition listed in the composition file, when maurer finds it (same as the randomized plate) https://github.com/mfbliposome/opentrons/blob/main/output/2023.11.07_ActiveLearning.xlsx
